Kactus is a tool to bring proper version control _(as in git)_ to designers _(only sketch users for now, but we need to start somewhere, right?)_.

This new tool is on the next level:

- it brings the entire git flow to sketch: branches, pull requests, team collaboration (you can work on the same file and automatically merge the changes), etc
- you can share pages across multiple sketch files
- you can publish pages on the internet and import them in another project _(soon)_!

that are being tracked against Kactus, and some of these issues have workarounds.

## :cactus: The issue I reported isn't fixed yet. What can I do?

If nobody has responded to your issue in a few days, you're welcome to respond to it with a friendly ping in the issue. Please do not respond more than a second time if nobody has responded. The Kactus maintainers are constrained in time and resources, and diagnosing individual configurations can be difficult and time consuming.
