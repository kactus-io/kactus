Kactus is a tool to bring proper version control _(as in git)_ to designers _(only sketch users for now, but we need to start somewhere, right?)_.

This new tool is on the next level:
- it brings the entire git flow to sketch: branches, pull requests, team collaboration (you can work on the same file and automatically merge the changes), etc
- you can share pages across multiple sketch files
- you can publish pages on the internet and import them in another project _(soon)_!
