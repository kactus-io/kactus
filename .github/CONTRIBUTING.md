### Help Wanted

As part of building Kactus, we'll identify tasks that are good for
external contributors to pick up. These tasks:

 - have low impact, or have a known workaround
 - should be addressed
 - have a narrow scope and/or easy reproduction steps
 - can be worked on independent of other tasks

These issues will be labeled as [`help wanted`](https://github.com/kactus-io/kactus/labels/help%20wanted)
in the repository. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please
comment on the issue to let the core team (and the community) know you are
interested in the issue.
